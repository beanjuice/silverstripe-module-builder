# silverstripe-module-builder

## Introduction

This script can be used to create SilverStripe vendor modules. It will generate a basic SilverStripe module structure.

Always execute the script from your root directory, i.e one level up the vendor directory.

Incase the module already exists, script will prompt for input from user for deleting the existing module and creates a new one.

Script will work on the fly in Mac or Linux machines. In windows execute it through Git Bash.

For detailed instructions and best practices for SilverStripe modules please refer to official SilverStripe web,
